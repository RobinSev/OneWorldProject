# OneWorldProject

## Context
This project was realised during the second year of my computer science licence degree. We worked in duo. 

**Objective :** the aim was to create a website in the theme of "making the world a better place". We decided to build a forum where people could share projects they were involved into to our users, gathering a community and planning event. 
**My participation :** I was mainly involved in the model and controller, even though I implemented some views. 

## Evaluation criteria
We were evaluated on : 

* the overall complexity of the project (linked to the time we had to realise it) to make us use everything we have been taught during class. 
* the respect of the theme. 
* the quality of the code (stability, readability, correctness and security). 

## Grade
19/20

## Improvments

* the implementation of tests functions (it wasn't ask as part of the evaluation). We made extended user tests to each part of the site, but it does not guarantee the stability of each function properly. 
* Segmenting the controller into smaller pieces. We found out a solution to do so, but this discovery came out too late in the project and implemented it would have required too much changes in our routes and controller, considering the time and work we had left.
* we wanted to add some functionalities, such as a newsletter system allowing a project manager to send information through email, and a notification system. But we lacked the time (considering this wasn't the only project and work we had to do at that time).
